<p>You can attend an event i at any day d where startDayi <= d <= endDayi. You can only attend one event at any time d.

    Return the maximum number of events you can attend.
</p>
<pre>
    Input: events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: You can attend all the three events.
    One way to attend them all is as shown.
    Attend the first event on day 1.
    Attend the second event on day 2.
    Attend the third event on day 3.
</pre>

<p>
    Idea: Which event to attend today? Order the events by start time. For each day from 1 to n (n is end time of last event), let us find out the event to attend.
    Take events that is running today i.e., have started and not ended yet. From them, attend the one that ends first.

            }
        }

        return ans;
