<h3>Example: Minimum Meeting Rooms Solution</h3>
<p>This code solves the problem of finding the <b>minimum number of conference rooms</b> required to accommodate a given set of meeting time intervals. The approach first sorts the meetings by their start times to process them chronologically. It then uses a <b>Min-Heap (PriorityQueue)</b> to keep track of the earliest ending time among all currently occupied rooms. If a new meeting's start time is greater than or equal to the earliest room end time (`allocator.peek()`), that room is freed up (`allocator.poll()`) and reused for the new meeting; otherwise, a new room is needed. The final size of the Min-Heap is the minimum number of rooms needed.</p>
